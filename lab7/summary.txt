In this lab I learned about Primary Keys in PostgreSQL.
Primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.
It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique.
I learned how to:
- create primary keys during table creation
- add composite primary keys
- use SERIAL for auto-increment values
- use IDENTITY columns
Primary keys also automatically create indexes and help maintain relationships between tables
