In this lab I learned about Foreign Keys and table relationships.
Foreign key connects one table to another using the primary key.
It helps maintain referential integrity between tables.
I practiced:
- creating foreign keys
- one-to-one relationship
- one-to-many relationship
- many-to-many relationship using junction table
Foreign keys ensure that related data remains consistent.
