In this lab I learned the basics of database design.
Database design is the process of organizing data efficiently before creating tables.
I studied Entity-Relationship modeling which includes:
- entities (tables)
- attributes (columns)
- relationships between tables.
I learned about normalization:
1NF – atomic values
2NF – no partial dependency
3NF– no transitive dependency
Good database design reduces redundancy, improves data integrity
and makes databases scalable and maintainable.
